# awaitedforsolong

Base for an async/await coding dojo.

## Setup

This project uses currently unstable alpha versions of libraries such as futures and hyper, so we nee rust nightly to compile.

Also, we need a rust version >= 1.39, you can check it by running.

```bash
rustc --version
// rustc 1.40.0-nightly (488381ce9 2019-09-28)
```

Installing the nightly rust compiler is exaplained [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.15.1/book/nightly-rust.html)


Then, once that is installed, you should just be able to use `cargo run` and your IP should be displayed.
